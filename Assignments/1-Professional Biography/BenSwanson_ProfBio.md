## Type of Project Sought
- I'm interested in creating an application that can use data analytics to project solutions to a given problem. I have experience in software development, and I've been able to build up my coding skills enough to effectively contribute to this project. This project will require many solutions to be implemented; I'm hoping to collaborate with some colleagues in order to have a diverse talent pool that can suitably tackle all the challenges that will be faced along the way.
