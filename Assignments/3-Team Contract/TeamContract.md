### Meeting Frequency
We plan to meet, at minimum, each Friday in person. In these meetings, we will provide each other with a status update of the work weâ€™ve completed. Once we are all on the same page, we will discuss what tasks need to be completed for the coming week and assign the work evenly between group members. We also plan to maintain constant communication via our Discord group chat, where we can communicate via voice or text.

### Project Focus
The goal of this project is to create a web application that provides financial investment information/predictions for its users. These predictions will be made by performing data analytics on past financial data. The data will consist of historical prices of major stocks and cryptocurrencies; all of the data will be stored in a database that is connected to the web application. We plan to use various data analytics algorithms to generate trends for the direction the economy is heading. These trends can then be used to advise users on which investments to make. 

### Roles
For our team, we will be separating our roles by a general focus while every team member will be involved with each aspect of the project. Nick will be leading the back-end development of the project, and in charge of the system design. Ben will be in charge of designing the UI/UX and focusing heavily on the front-end of the project. Jack will be in charge of leading the way of gathering the data and assorting it and understanding it and handing it off to Nick and Ben.
